# ETL-Project-Birds
Bird attacks are a growing problem in the US. In order to understand the data pattern better we will be combining data from bird strikes on buildings with bird strikes on aircraft into a singular database that could be further examined by wildlife experts, conservancy agencies, and city/airport operations. We will be combining on species, in Chicago, within the past year.

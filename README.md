# ETL-Project-Birds
Bird stikes cost the aviation industry an estimated 937 million annually and can be dangerous to travelers. In order to understand bird strike incidents better we will be combining data from reported bird strike data, flight data, and bird population data to indentify trends to potentially avoid the damages it causes to both wildlife and airplanes. We will be looking at data from Chicago over multiple years.

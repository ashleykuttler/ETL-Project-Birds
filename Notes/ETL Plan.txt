ETL PLAN:

Data Clean:
1)chicago building strike data: aggregate # of building strikes grouped by species and date 2004-2016
2)airplane strike data: aggregate # of airplane strikes in chicaco, 2004-2016, grouped by species and date
3) join data sets on species and date...this will require cleaning up naming conventions  (explore pandas fuzzywuzzy module)
4) final tables should be structured:
	
	PK_SPECIES_ID
	SPECIES
	GENOME
	
	PK_ID
	DATE_OF_INCIDENT
	QTY_BLD_STRIKES
	CITY
	SPECIES_ID

	PK_ID
	FK_SPECIES_ID
	FK_AIRPORT
	DATE_OF_INCIDENT
	QTY_AIRPLANE_STRIKE
	EST_DAMAGE_COST	

	PK_ID
	DATE_OF_DEPARTURE
	FK_AIPPORT	
	QTY_FLIGHTS

	PK_ID
	SPECIES_ID
	REGION
	YEAR
	EST POPULATION
  


Q1)  is there a relationship between building strkes and airplane strikes by species and time of year
Q2)  Are bird strikes and bld strikes increasing?


Other datat sets to consider:
# of commercial flights 
est bird populations by region

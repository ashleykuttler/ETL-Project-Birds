ETL PLAN:

Data Clean up (SQL):
1)chicago building strike data: aggregate # of building strikes grouped by species and date
2)airplane strike data: aggregate # of airplane strikes in chicaco, in 2018, grouped species by date
3) join data sets on species...this will require cleaning up naming conventions by defining list variable and joining on a wild card condition
4) final table should be structuured:
	PK_ID
	DATE_OF_INCIDENT
	QTY_BLD_STRIKE
	QTY_AIRPLANE_STRIKE
	SPECIES

Q1)  is there a relationship between building strkes and airplane strikes by speciec and time of year
